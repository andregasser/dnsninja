--=[ Introduction ]=---------------------------------------------------//

This is the list of open issues, ideas and so forth which I have 
collected over time. 


--[ To Do's ]------------------------------------------------------------

+ Add IPv6 Support

  It shall be able to query DNS servers listening on IPv6 addresses. It 
  shall also be possible to query DNS servers for AAAA resource records.


+ Support CIDR notation an IP ranges

  When conducting reverse dns lookups it is easier to specify ip ranges
  by using CIDR notation or using the hyphen (-) character such as:
    160.40.100.0/24
    160.40.5.1-160.40.5.255
    
  This makes files much shorter (you can write 160.40.100.0/24 instead of
  listing each ip address individually.
  

+ Better Thread Configuration

  The user shall be able to specify the number of threads to use.
  Possible parameter: --threads=x, -t x

    
+ Request Throttling Parameter

  The use shall have the possibility to throttle DNS requests. This
  avoids high traffic on dns servers in a short time. 

  
+ Integrate Pre-made Word List

  A ready-to-use word list shall be provided to enable the user to
  quickly use the tool without generating word lists on its own.
  

+ Create Install Target in Makefile

  This makes installation easier.


+ Improve Memory Allocation / Memory Management Code

  Especially malloc() and (free) usage shall be improved. Check memory 
  usage with valgrind.
  
  
+ Improve Linked List Handling

  This can be done better for sure.
  
  
+ Create MAN Page

  This is required too.
  
  
+ Pipe Support

  Support pipe operator.
