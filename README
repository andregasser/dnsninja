--[ 2 - The tool ]------------------------------------------------------

----[ 2.1 - Overview ]--------------------------------------------------

DNSMAP is a tool to query DNS servers by using prepared wordlists.
People usually use a tool like this, if the are not the owner of the
DNS server and therefore do not have access to the zone data on the 
server. Nevertheless, they want to enumerate / discover hosts located in
a certain zone.

By using DNSMAP, they get the possibility to do forward DNS lookups by
providing a list of hostnames. But they can also do reverse DNS lookups
(aka inverse DNS lookups) to identify domain names based on ip
addresses.

A tool like this can generate heavy load on the target. It is therefore
adviced to take caution. System administrators at the target's site
could interpret such scans as some kind of attack and take counter-
measures.

You have been warned.


----[ 2.2 - Features ]--------------------------------------------------

the current version of DNSMAP offers the following features:

  + Do forward DNS lookups based on wordlist
  + Do reverse DNS lookups based on a list of ip addresses
  + Query up to five DNS servers in parallel to distribute the load
  + Save the results to a text file
  + Supports different verbosity levels for output
  

----[ 2.3 - Usage ]-----------------------------------------------------

----[ 2.3.1 - Command-line arguments ]----------------------------------

The following command-line arguments are supported:

--reverse, -r                   

    Do reverse DNS lookups. If not specified, a forward DNS lookup will
    be performed.

--servers=<ip1,ip2,...>, -s <ip1,ip2,...>
	
	List of DNS servers, which shall be used as targets for DNS queries.

--domain=<domain name>, -d <domain name>

    When doing forward DNS lookups, the top- and second-level-domain can 
    be specified here (e.g. foo.org).

--inputfile=<filename>, -i <filename>      

    The file containing either a list of ip-addresses or host names, 
    depending on the lookup mode (reverse, forward).
                                
--outputfile=<filename>, -o <filename>     

    Allows you to write the query results into a simple, comma-separated
    CSV-file. This allows you to further process the results in other 
    tools.
                                
--verbosity=<level>, -v <level>         

    Specify verbosity level. The following levels are allowed:
        1 = Errors only
        2 = Informational output
        3 = Debug Output

--help, -h

----[ 2.3.2 - Doing forward DNS lookups ]-------------------------------

Usage of this tool is quite simple. Do do a simple forward DNS lookup
search based on a wordlist, run the following command:

$ ./dnsmap -s 111.222.333.444 -d mydomain.com -i myhosts.txt

This connects to the DNS server 111.222.333.444 and sends queries for the
mydomain.com domain. It uses the file myhosts.txt which contains entries like
these:

$ cat myhosts.txt
www
backup
mail
webmail
gatekeeper
www1
www2
www3

The myhosts.txt file and the specified domain are used to form DNS queries
such as:

www.mydomain.com
backup.mydomain.com
...

If a host has been found, the ip address of this host is returned.


----[ 2.3.3 - Doing reverse DNS lookups ]-------------------------------

Doing reverse DNS lookups works similar. To do reverse DNS lookups based
on a list of ip addresses, run the following command:

$ ./dnsmap -r -s 111.222.333.444 -i myips.txt

Again, the DNS server 111.222.333.444 is contacted to DNS PTR queries will
be sent to this machine. As a result, you will receive the name of the 
domains associated with that ip. 


----[ 2.3.4 - Saving output to a file ]---------------------------------




----[ 2.4 - How to get it ]---------------------------------------------

You'll always find the latest version of this tool on GitHub.

blabla...


----[ 2.5 - Building from source ]--------------------------------------

The source distribution can be built from source by invoking the
following commands on your box:

$ gunzip dnsmap-<version>.tar.gz
$ tar xvf dnsmap-<version>.tar

Then switch into the newly created directory and compile it using:

$ make

Optionally, you can compile it in debug mode using:

$ make DEBUG=1
