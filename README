--[ 1 - Introduction ]--------------------------------------------------

DNS servers are an important source of information during information
gathering in a penetration testing project. Attackers / penetration
testers use data in DNS servers to obtain knowledge about live systems.
DNS servers become even more important in the IPv6 world, where simple
subnet scanning won't be possible anymore due to the huge address space
provided.
This tool shall support penetration testers during their information 
gathering activities and reduce the need for manual, repetitive tasks.


--[ 2 - The Tool ]------------------------------------------------------

----[ 2.1 - Overview ]--------------------------------------------------

DNSNINJA is a tool to query DNS servers by either using a prepared word
list to send forward DNS lookup queries or a list of ip addresses to
send reverse DNS lookup queries. It allows the user to quickly enumerate
hosts in a DNS domain or an ip range. The tool is mainly aimed at 
pentesters and shall provide support in their daily job during 
information gathering. 

A tool like this can generate heavy load on the target. It is therefore
adviced to take caution. System administrators at the target's site
could interpret such scans as a certain type of attack and take counter-
measures. Therefore, use with caution.

You have been warned.


----[ 2.2 - Features ]--------------------------------------------------

the current version of DNSNINJA offers the following features:

  + Supports multi-threading
  + Do forward DNS lookups based on wordlist
  + Do reverse DNS lookups based on a list of ip addresses
  + Query up to five DNS servers in parallel to distribute the load
  + Save the results to a text file
  + Supports different log levels
  

----[ 2.3 - Usage ]-----------------------------------------------------

This chapter explains basic usage of DNSNINJA.


----[ 2.3.1 - Command-line Arguments ]----------------------------------

The following command-line arguments are supported:

--reverse, -r                   

    Do a reverse DNS lookup. If not specified, a forward DNS lookup will
    be performed.

--servers=<ip1,ip2,...>, -s <ip1,ip2,...>
	
	List of DNS servers, which shall be used as targets for DNS queries.

--domain=<domain name>, -d <domain name>

    Specify the domain to be queried. Only used when doing forward 
    DNS lookups (e.g. -d foo.org).

--inputfile=<filename>, -i <filename>      

    The file containing either a list of ip addresses or host names, 
    depending on the lookup mode (reverse, forward).
                                
--outputfile=<filename>, -o <filename>     

    Allows you to write the query results into a simple, comma-separated
    text file. This allows you to further process the results in other 
    tools.
                                
--loglevel=<level>, -l <level>         

    Specifies the desired log level. The following levels are supported:
        1 = ERROR (Log errors only)
        2 = INFO (Log additional information)
        3 = DEBUG (Log debug level information)

--version, -v

    Displays version information.

--help, -h 

    Display help page.


----[ 2.3.2 - Doing Forward DNS Lookups ]-------------------------------

Usage of this tool is quite simple. Do do a simple forward DNS lookup
search based on a wordlist, run the following command:

$ ./dnsninja -s 111.222.333.444 -d mydomain.com -i myhosts.txt

This connects to the DNS server 111.222.333.444 and sends queries for the
mydomain.com domain. It uses the file myhosts.txt which contains entries like
these:

$ cat myhosts.txt
www
backup
mail
webmail
gatekeeper
www1
www2
www3

The myhosts.txt file and the specified domain are used to form DNS queries
such as:

www.mydomain.com
backup.mydomain.com
...

If a host has been found, the ip address of this host is returned.


----[ 2.3.3 - Doing Reverse DNS Lookups ]-------------------------------

Doing reverse DNS lookups works similar. To do reverse DNS lookups based
on a list of ip addresses, run the following command:

$ ./dnsninja -r -s 111.222.333.444 -i myips.txt

Again, the DNS server 111.222.333.444 is contacted to DNS PTR queries will
be sent to this machine. As a result, you will receive the name of the 
domains associated with that ip. 


----[ 2.3.4 - Saving Output to a File ]---------------------------------

DNSNINJA displays the results on screen. But sometimes it is desirable
to save the results to a text file. You can do this by specifying the
-o option on the command line like this:

$ ./dnsninja -s 111.222.333.444 -d mydomain.com 
    -i myhosts.txt -o results.txt


----[ 2.4 - Building from Source ]--------------------------------------

Befor you can build the tool from source, your system must meet some
preconditions. Currently they are:

  + gcc must be installed.
  + make must be installed.

The source distribution can be built from source by conducting the
following steps on your box:

  1. Copy the file dnsninja-<version>.tar.gz to your linux box. Make
     sure, it is located in a dedicated directory, since extraction
	 will put the files directly in there.

  2. Extract the tarball using:

     $ tar xvf dnsninja-<version>.tar.gz

  3. Compile the source code using:

     $ make

	 Optionally, you can compile it in debug mode in order to add debug
	 information to the resulting binary. You'll need that only if you
	 like to debug using gdb. To create a debug binary invoke:

     $ make DEBUG=1

The resulting binary is now ready to use.

As for now, I've tested the binary on the following platforms and it
just runs fine:

+ Arch Linux
+ Debian 6 Squeeze
+ Cygwin

----[ 2.8 - Reporting Bugs and Features ]-------------------------------

This software is probably far away from a bug-free state. Because of
this, I am very glad to receive feedback from you regarding DNSNINJA.
